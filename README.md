You are a detective that is trying to get away for an unplugged retreat at a mansion in the middle of the woods, however when you arrive your host has been recently killed and it is up to you to solve the mystery. You can interact with the world by typing commands such as 'go west', 'take letter', or 'ask ava about the victim', your goal is to pick up objects and explore the mansion in order to interrogate the guests and figure out who killed the host. When you have figured it out, you can go to the phone in the grand foyer and call the police.
