"{\"id\": \"R04\", \"name\": \"Secret Room\", \"desc\": \"You see a cold windowless room in front of you. It was clearly designated as a secret room by the owner of the house. The sides of the room are made of rough brick with a wood floor. The room is dark. A single lamp stands near the exit to the library.

The room is bare, with few decorations and only a single side table and chair as furniture. \\nThe library is behind you to the west.\", \"sdesc\": \"The secret room is cold and dark.

At first, it is silent until you hear someone speak in one of the other rooms. 'The target has been eliminated.
