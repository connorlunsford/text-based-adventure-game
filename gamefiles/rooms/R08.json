"{\"id\": \"R08\", \"name\": \"Garage\", \"desc\": \"You enter a large garage. This thing is huge! There's only one car though, a vintage VW van that looks like it's kept immaculate. In the back corner there is a large storage closet. A workbench along the far wall looks very orderly with tools. To the east is the door back into the kitchen. To the north is the back door. It opens onto a paved path that will take you around the back of the house to the patio. To the south are the main garage doors. There's a fancy looking keypad though, and no button in sight. It appears you need a code to open the doors from inside. \", \"sdesc\": \"You enter a large well-kept garage with a vintage VW and a large storage closet.
