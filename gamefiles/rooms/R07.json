A maze of flowers and plants lies before you, all immaculately manicured and cared for. It seems every color of the rainbow is represented through the beautiful flowers. A particularly beautiful purple flower in the far corner catches your eye. As you start to head that way to get a better look, you spot something metallic down another path, shimmering in the sunlight. 'Well, that seems out of place,' you think to yourself.\\nTo the north you see a large greenhouse. In the northeast corner is the gardener's tool shed. Going west will return you to the patio.\\nThere's so much to see you don't know which way to go first.\", \"sdesc\": \"You enter an immaculately manicured garden.
