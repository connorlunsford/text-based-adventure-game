A small amount of daylight streams in through a curtained window on the opposite end of the hallway, exposing floating dust in the air and providing a sliver of light by which you make out some of the features within the hallway. Four rooms connect to the hallway: a bathroom to the southeast, a study to the northeast, a master bedroom to the northwest, and a second bedroom to the northeast. Going south will lead you back to the grand foyer downstairs.\", \"sdesc\": \"You find yourself in a dimly lit hallway.
