"{\"id\": \"R06\", \"name\": \"Patio\", \"desc\": \"The patio and pool deck look fit for a party. Lounge chairs are lined up along the south edge of the pool. A small dining area is on the southeast corner of the patio, complete with a massive umbrella to provide shade from the sun. Let's not forget about the pool. It sparkles and shimmers and looks so inviting. Maybe when all of this is over you can go for a nice swim. \\nTo the west are french doors that appear to go into the living room. The doors are locked. You can get to the garage via the path to the northwest. To the north is a pool house. It doesn't look like it's currently being used and the doors are also locked. \\nTo the east is the garden. It looks rather beatiful from here. There seem to be some outbuildings on the far edges of the garden, but you can't quite tell from here what they are. There are some muddy footprints coming out of the garden, maybe they deserve a closer look. \\nTo the south are french doors that will take you back into the house via the library.\", \"sdesc\": \"You are on the patio with a dazzling pool and ample seating for lounging or dining.
