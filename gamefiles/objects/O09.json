What was it, 10 years ago? That was one of the happiest times of my life.\\n I know you think that our break up was for the best, and I know that our relationship could be unhealthy at times, but I really do think that we were meant to be together. I mean, after all, there must be a reason why you haven't dated anyone else after all these years.\\n Anyway, I know that, like always, you likely won't respond to this, but I'll be in your area in a couple weeks for work and I was thinking that maybe I could stop by.\\nLove,\\n     A.S.\"}, \"hidden\": true}"
